# Comment
Hierbei handelt es sich um ein User Script, welches eine editierbare Liste mit Kommentaren zu dem Online Uebungssystem der Fernuniversität Hagen hinzufügt.

![Beispiel](https://github.com/pecheur/jscomment/blob/master/example.png)

# Installation
Das Firefox Addon Greasemonkey erlaubt es eigene JavaScript-Scripte in Webseiten einzubetten.

1. Installation von [**Firefox**](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
2. Installation von [**Greasemonkey**](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) Addon
3. Installation von [**Comment**](https://github.com/pecheur/jscomment/raw/master/comment.user.js) User Script.

# Todo
* Whenever a line is pasted, a whitespace is added automatically. This is not necessary for line breaks. But the HTML-Line Break doesn't seem to work without a whitespace. Solution in version 4: Each line is pasted as paragraph and holding CTRL-Key pastes the item without line breaks.
* A text line is called item, maybe snippet is a better.

# Updates
## Version 3
* Mark/Unmark items for better visibility in the list. (Testing)
* Node states are going to be saved and synced between multiple tabs now. Closed folders remain closed.

## Version 2
* Removed Paste, Clipboard Options in Context-Menu
* Added simple Insert by single left click on an Item
* tabs sync after changes to the tree.
* search bar removed

## Version 1
* Für aktuelle Aufgaben angepasst.
* Context-Menu -> Paste: implementiert
* Automatic script update enabled
* Pay attention: not compatible with jscomment beta. Backup your tree and load it in the new version.
